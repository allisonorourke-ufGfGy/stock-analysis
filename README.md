# Stock Analysis for Module 2
## Introduction
### Purpose
#### The purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of a number of different stocks to determine which stock would be most beneficial to invest in. This project specifically looked at 12 stocks and how they preformed in 2 years. This project looked to refactor different code to make the code run more efficiently and faster.
## Results
### 2017 vs. 2018 perfomance 
#### In 2017 the stock return was overall very positive. There was only one stock, TERP, that had an overall negative return for the year. This can be seen in the following image. The average return for the 12 stocks this year was 67.3%. The average total daily volume for all  of the stocks was 263,886,592.

All of the other stocks had negative returns varying from -3.54% to -62.60%. The overall average return for this year is -8.51%. The average total daily volume for this year is 275,503,183.

### Time run comparison
#### During the first run through of code we added in a line that allowed us to look at the time that it took to run the code. Before we refactored the code the time it took to run the analysis on the 2017 data was .9375 seconds, as seen below. The time it took to run the 2018 data was .8398438 seconds, as seen below.
