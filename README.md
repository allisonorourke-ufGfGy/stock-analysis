# Stock Analysis for Module 2
## Introduction
### Purpose
#### The purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of a number of different stocks to determine which stock would be most beneficial to invest in. This project specifically looked at 12 stocks and how they preformed in 2 years. This project looked to refactor different code to make the code run more efficiently and faster. Refactoring code is a very important part of coding. It is done through taking existing code and changing it so that it is more efficient and can be run at faster times. When refactoring code you are not necessiarly looking to add new code or new capabilities.
### Background
#### You have afriend named Steve whose parents asked him to invest some of their money on stocks. The parents met at a Dairy Queen so they want to invest in a stock called DQ. Steve requests your help to run analysis on different stocks and their performance to see if it is smart to invest their money with that company. His parents requested that the money be invested in a green company that focuses on renewable energy. Steve wants to look at 8 different companies to see how their stock did over 2 years.
## Results
### 2017 vs. 2018 perfomance 
#### In 2017 the stock return was overall very positive. There was only one stock, TERP, that had an overall negative return for the year. This can be seen in the following image. The average return for the 12 stocks this year was 67.3%. The average total daily volume for all  of the stocks was 263,886,592.

#### In 2018, there were only 2 stock returns that were positive. ENPH and RUN were the only 2 positive returns and they ended up with returns 81.92% and 83.95% respectively. All of the other stocks had negative returns varying from -3.54% to -62.60%. The overall average return for this year is -8.51%. The average total daily volume for this year is 275,503,183.

### Time run comparison
#### During the first run through of code we added in a line that allowed us to look at the time that it took to run the code. Before we refactored the code the time it took to run the analysis on the 2017 data was 1.179688 seconds, as seen below. The time it took to run the 2018 data was 1.21875 seconds, as seen below.

#### After refactoring this code, the times for each of the time sheets went down. The time it took to run the analysis on the 2017 data was .9375 seconds, as seen below. The time it took to run the 2018 data was .8398438 seconds, as seen below.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Advantages
1. Refactoring code allows us to clean up the code which makes it easier to work with and allows us to go back later and add code or create updates. 
2. Refactoring code also allows for the code to run faster. When running a large code this allows for time to be saved and it also will allow for money to be saved as well. Because it is also readable which allows for the company to save more money because they do not have to spend more time running code or going through the code in the future.
3. Removing unnecessary code will allow the code to be scaled up in the future much more easily.
#### Disadvantages
1. Refactoring code can be very time-consuming and after you start it could take more time than you thought.
2. Refactoring code can cost more money because someone has to take time to go through and do it.
3. It can be hard for someone who is not the writer to go through and refactor the code if they do not understand it or if the code is not clear to begin with.
